I grew up in Northern Virginia, right outside of D.C and have always maintained a burning passion for Computer Science and technology. In addition to CS, I love music, culture, philosophy, and lifting. So if I'm not in a class, grinding at Uris, sleeping in Donlon, golfing at Robert Trent, eating at Appel, or lifting at Teagle, then I'm usually walking to one of those places.",
