      grinding at Uris, sleeping in Donlon, golfing at Robert Trent, eating at
      Appel, or lifting at Teagle, then I'm usually walking to one of those
      places.`,

    majors in Computer Science and plans to minor in Engineering Entrepreneurship.
    
    Through URMC, Raheel has found purpose. He knew he wanted to serve the
    members of his community but he didn’t know how and feared his time was
    running out. Raheel believes URMs have unlimited potential but can often
    lack the confidence necessary to reach their full potential. Raheel believes
    it is his responsibility to make sure that he uplifts himself and his fellow
    URMs and leverages all of the knowledge at his disposal to help actualize
    their goals and dreams.
    
    He loves photography, coding, learning, (trying to love) reading, and
    stepping out of his comfort zone.
    
    He values self-reflection, self-accountability, self-discipline, and
    self-control.`,

    didn't make it to where I am alone, so URMC is a great vector for me to give
    back to the communities that have continually supported me and provide them
    with the resources, inspiration, and encouragement necessary to maximize
    their potentials.

    Outside of URMC, I am currently the External Vice President of Cornell's
    chapter of the National Society of Black Engineers, the Vice President of
    Scholars Working Ambitiously to Graduate, a Backend Developer on Cornell
